## egs\_brachy

egs\_brachy is an egs++ application for rapid brachytherapy calculations
for both photon and electron sources. Some features of egs\_brachy
include:

- Dose scoring via a tracklength estimator or interaction scoring
- Scoring of the spectrum of particles emitted from a source or particle
  fluence in a voxel
- Primary and scatter separated dose calculations
- Particle recycling for simulations with multiple sources
- Bremsstrahlung cross section enhancement, uniform bremsstrahlung
  splitting, and Russian Roulette for efficient electronic brachytherapy
  simulations.
- A comprehensive library of brachytherapy source geometries ,

For a complete discussion of all egs\_brachy features as well as
discussions about benchmarking and calculation efficiency, please refer
to the paper listed below.

The initial release of egs_brachy is version 2017.09.15 beta. We will continue
to update and maintain egs_brachy, as well as this manual and the html
documentation.
