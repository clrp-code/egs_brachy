\section gen_info General Information

egs_brachy is an egs++ application for rapid brachytherapy calculations for both photon and electron sources.  The current documentation serves as a Technical Reference Manual to complement the egs_brachy user manual (https://clrp-code.github.io/egs_brachy/pdf/egs_brachy_user_manual.pdf) and our initial egs_brachy paper (https://clrp-code.github.io/egs_brachy/pdf/egs_brachy_paper2016.pdf):   MJP Chamberland, REP Taylor, DWO Rogers, and RM Thomson, egs_brachy: a versatile and fast Monte Carlo code for brachytherapy, Phys. Med. Biol. 61, 8214-8231 (2016).  Please cite this paper when egs_brachy is used in publications.

egs_brachy was written by [Randle Taylor](http://randlet.com) in collaboration with Marc Chamberland, Dave Rogers, and Rowan Thomson of the [Carleton Laboratory for Radiotherapy Physics](http://www.physics.carleton.ca/clrp/).

\section installationinstruct Installation instructions (including EGSnrc installation)


    git clone https://github.com/clrp-code/EGSnrc_with_egs_brachy.git
    cd EGSnrc_with_egs_brachy

Checkout the most-up-to-date 'egs\_brachy' branch and download the egs\_brachy user code:

    git checkout egs_brachy
    git submodule update --init --recursive

Finally, configure EGSnrc by following the instructions for your OS (skip Step
2, which is already completed if youâ€™ve been following these instructions):

- Linux: https://github.com/nrc-cnrc/EGSnrc/wiki/Install-EGSnrc-on-Linux
- Mac: https://github.com/nrc-cnrc/EGSnrc/wiki/Install-EGSnrc-on-OS-X-El-Capitan
- Windows: https://github.com/nrc-cnrc/EGSnrc/wiki/Install-EGSnrc-on-Windows


At this point you should have everything required to run egs\_brachy. If you
did not choose to compile it when configuring EGSnrc, you should do so now:

    cd $EGS_HOME/egs_brachy
    make

\section usage Usage

\subsection runcontrol Run Control

egs\_brachy uses the same run control block as other egs++ user codes
with the addition of one extra input `egsdat file format` which you
can use to tell egs\_brachy to output its egsdat file in gzip format.
Using gzip format can result in significantly smaller egsdat file sizes
for simulations with a large number of regions defined.

\verbatim
:start run control:
    ncase = 10000
    nbatch=1
    geometry error limit = 10
    egsdat file format = gzip # gzip or text
:stop run control:
\endverbatim


\subsection runmodes Run Modes

There are currently three different run modes available in egs_brachy:

1. 'normal' (default):  a regular simulation. For an example see [tests/seeds_in_xyz/seeds_in_xyz.egsinp](https://github.com/clrp-code/egs_brachy/blob/master/egs_brachy/tests/seeds_in_xyz/seeds_in_xyz.egsinp).
2. 'superposition' : This type of simulation requires the used of an
EGS_ASwitchedEnvelope as the simulation geometry. At the start of every
history only a single inscribed geometry will be activated. This allows
you to explore the effects of intersource attenuation by performing TG-43
dose superposition type calculations. For an example see [tests/tg43mode/tg43mode.egsinp](https://github.com/clrp-code/egs_brachy/blob/master/egs_brachy/tests/tg43mode/tg43mode.egsinp).
3. 'volume correction only': Just run the volume correction routines, print
the results and then quit. No actual dose calculations will be done. For an example see [tests/volume_correction/vc.egsinp](https://github.com/clrp-code/egs_brachy/blob/master/egs_brachy/tests/volume_correction/vc.egsinp).


The run mode is set using a 'run mode' input block:

\verbatim
:start run mode:

    run mode = normal # 'normal', 'superposition', or 'volume correction only'

:stop run mode:
\endverbatim

In simulations with more than a single source, egs_brachy uses the first source
as a particle generator.  That is, all particles are initiated at the location
of the first source and transported until they escape the source geometry. From
there, the particle is moved to the location of the next source before
transport continues (more accurately, a new particle is added to the top of the
stack at the location of the chosen source and the original particle is
killed).

This behaviour can be disabled by setting `single generator = no` in the run
mode block (see [tests/single_generator/single_generator.egsinp](https://github.com/clrp-code/egs_brachy/blob/master/egs_brachy/tests/single_generator/single_generator.egsinp)).

\verbatim

:start run mode:
    run mode = normal
    single generator = no
:stop run mode:

\endverbatim

Disabling the single generator (see [tests/single_generator/multiple_generator.egsinp](https://github.com/clrp-code/egs_brachy/blob/master/egs_brachy/tests/single_generator/multiple_generator.egsinp)) mode may be slightly faster for some simulations
(there is an extra call to howfar for every particle escaping the source
 geometry in single generator mode). Note that in some situations (particle
 recycling for example) single generator will always be enabled by egs_brachy.

\subsection geomspec Geometry Specification

In general, arbitrary egs++ geometries can be included in a simulation
although, for the sake of efficiency, it is expected that EGS_AEnvelope geometries
will be used for most simulations.

There are three egs_brachy specific input keys that are required for the
'geometry definition' input block (in addition to the standard egs++
'simulation geometry' key):

1. 'source geometries' : this key specifies which geometries define the actual
   brachytherapy source object. This may be a single geometry name (e.g. when
       using the `egs_glib` shim to load an externally defined geometry) or a
   list of all the sub-geometries used to compose a single source geometry when
   definining geometries inline.

2. 'phantom geometries': this tells egs_brachy which geometries to score dose
   in (1 or more phantom geometries are required).  Currently 3 geometry types
   are allowed to be used as phantoms:
    1. EGS_XYZGeometry (library egs_ndgeometry, see [tests/seeds_in_xyz/seeds_in_xyz.egsinp](https://github.com/clrp-code/egs_brachy/blob/master/egs_brachy/tests/seeds_in_xyz/seeds_in_xyz.egsinp))
    2. EGS_RZGeometry (library egs_rz, see [tests/stepped_source/stepped.egsinp](https://github.com/clrp-code/egs_brachy/blob/master/egs_brachy../tests/stepped_source/stepped.egsinp))
    3. EGS_cSpheres (library egs_spheres, see [tests/scatter/scatter.egsinp](../tests/scatter/scatter.egsinp))

3. 'source envelope geometry':  this input is only required for
   superposition run mode and must name the EGS_ASwitchedEnvelope
   geometry that contains the sources.

Other phantom geometry types could be added in future provided they implement the
getBound, getNRegDir, and getMass methods of the EGS_BaseGeometry class.

An (abbreviated) example geometry specification might look like:
\verbatim
:start geometry definition:

  # all geometries that are a part of the source
  source geometries = planes, end_cap_1, seed_middle, end_cap_2, seed

  phantom geometries = phantom

  simulation geometry = phantom_w_seeds

  # only required for superposition run mode
  source envelope geometry = phantom_w_seeds

  :start geometry:

      name = phantom
      library = egs_ndgeometry
      type    = EGS_XYZGeometry

      # rest of geom definition

  :stop geometry:

  :start geometry:
      library = egs_planes
      name = planes
      # ...
  :stop geometry:

  :start geometry:
        name = end_cap_1
        #...
  :stop geometry:

  :start geometry:
        name = seed_middle
        #...
  :stop geometry:

  :start geometry:
        name = end_cap_2
        #...
  :stop geometry:

  :start geometry:

      library = egs_cdgeometry
      name = seed
      base geometry = planes
      set geometry = 0 end_cap_1
      set geometry = 1 seed_middle
      set geometry = 2 end_cap_2

  :stop geometry:

  :start geometry:

      library = egs_autoenvelope
      name = phantom_w_seeds
      base geometry = phantom

      :start inscribed geometry:

          inscribed geometry name = seed

          # rest of auto envelope inscribed geom definition

      :stop inscribed geometry:

  :stop geometry:

:stop geometry definition:

\endverbatim

\subsubsection ctdata Using CT data to create phantoms

Using the `egs_glib` geometry library you can construct an `EGS_XYZGeometry`
using a `.egsphant` file like so:

\verbatim

:start geometry:
    library = egs_glib
    type = egsphant
    name = my_egsphant_geom
    egsphant file = /path/to/some/egsphant/file
    density file = /path/to/density/file
:stop geometry:

\endverbatim

The egsphant file may either be a typical .egsphant text file or gzipped .egsphant.gz file, and the latter compressed format is often advantageous in terms of memory)  The density file indicates to egs_brachy the nominal density of each medium in the egsphant (voxel-by-voxel densities are defined in the egsphant file), and currently egs_brachy can read these data from a (a) material.dat file, (b) pegs4 data file, or (c) a simple text file of the format:

\verbatim

MEDIUM=WATER
RHO=1.000
MEDIUM=AIR
RHO=1.2E-3

\endverbatim


*Note the egs_glib geometry library in the main EGSnrc repository does not currently
contain support for egsphant files.  The egs_glib contained in the egs_brachy git branch is
customized to include support for egsphant files.*

It is also possible to use the egs_ndgeometry library to contstruct an `EGS_XYZGeometry`
using a `.egsphant` file like so:

\verbatim

:start geometry:

    library = egs_ndgeometry
    type =  EGS_XYZGeometry
    name = my_egsphant_geom
    egsphant file = /path/to/some/egsphant/file
    ct ramp = /path/to/ramp/file.ramp

:stop geometry:

\endverbatim

See the `egs_ndgeometry` documentation for details about the format
of the ct ramp file.  Note, however, that the egs_ndgeometry approach assumes that there is no overlap in voxel mass densities for different media in the egsphant, i.e., each medium has a distinct and non-overlapping range of mass densities.  This is often *not* the case for brachytherapy phantoms, and so using the `egs_glib` geometry with `.egsphant` files (gzip format) is recommended.

\subsubsection geomlib The geometry library

The geometry library (see [The Geometry Library](#libgeom) below) consists of useful phantom geometries (
[lib/geometry/phantoms](../lib/geometry/phantoms)), source geometries and radioactivity
distributions [lib/geometry/sources](../lib/geometry/sources),
eye plaques [lib/geometry/eye_plaques](../lib/geometry/eye_plaques) and sets of transformations
[lib/geometry/transformations/](../lib/geometry/transformations/).


\subsection scoringopts Scoring options

The 'scoring options' input block currently has the following keys:

- 'muen file': path to the file containing the muen data required for the
   simulation.  See the MuenDataParser class for more information about the
   format of this file.
- 'muen for media': (Optional) a list of the materials that muen data is required for.
   Dose will be set to 0 for any phantom media that don't have muen data
   available. (Can be used instead of or in conjunction with `muen for medium`).

- 'muen for medium': (Optional) one or more input blocks which specify the muen dataset
   to be used for a given transport medium.  (Can be used instead of or in conjunction
   with `muen for media`) This allows you to, for example, transport particles in tissue
   but score in water with notation Dw,m according to the conventions of TG-186.

\verbatim
    :start muen for medium:
        transport medium = TISSUE
        scoring medium = WATER
    :stop muen for medium:
\endverbatim

- 'score tracklength dose' : (Optional) Controls whether dose using a tracklength
    estimator is scored in the phantom geometries. The choices are 'yes' (default) or
   'no'.

- 'score energy deposition' : (Optional) Controls whether dose from particle
  interactions is scored in the phantom geometries. The choices are 'yes' or
  'no' (default). See
  [tests/brem_cyl/brem_cyl.egsinp](https://github.com/clrp-code/egs_brachy/blob/master/egs_brachy/tests/brem_cyl/brem_cyl.egsinp) for an
  example

- 'score scatter dose' : (Optional) Controls whether scatter dose (normalized
  to total radiant energy) is scored in the phantom geometries. The choices are
  'yes' or 'no' (default). See

- 'spectrum scoring': (Optional) zero or more input blocks specifying spectra
  to score (described below). See
  [tests/spec_absolute/spec_absolute.egsinp](https://github.com/clrp-code/egs_brachy/blob/master/egs_brachy/tests/spec_absolute/spec_absolute.egsinp),
  [tests/spec_eflu/spec_eflu.egsinp](https://github.com/clrp-code/egs_brachy/blob/master/egs_brachy/tests/spec_eflu/spec_eflu.egsinp), and
  [tests/spec_vox/spec_vox.egsinp](https://github.com/clrp-code/egs_brachy/blob/master/egs_brachy/tests/spec_vox/spec_vox.egsinp) for
  examples.

- 'phsp scoring': (Optional) zero or one input block specifying whether to
  score a phase space on the surface of the source (described below). See

    for an example.

- 'dose file format': (Optional) Controls whether 3dddose files are
   written as text or gzipped text files. Options are 'text' (default) and 'gzip'.

- 'output egsphant files': (Optional) Controls whether egsphant files are
   created for scoring phantoms. Options are 'no' (default) and 'yes'.

- 'egsphant file format': (Optional) Controls whether egsphant files are
   written as text or gzipped text files. Options are 'text' (default) and 'gzip'.

- 'output voxel info files': (Optional) Controls whether voxel info files are
  created for scoring phantoms. Options are 'no' (default) and 'yes'. See below
  for a description of these files. See
  [tests/volume_correction/vc.egsinp](https://github.com/clrp-code/egs_brachy/blob/master/egs_brachy/tests/volume_correction/vc.egsinp) for
  an example.

- 'voxel info file format': (Optional) Controls whether voxel info
    files are written in text (default) or gzip format

- 'output volume correction files for phantoms': (Optional) Controls which phantoms
    will have volume correction files created.

- 'volume correction file format': (Optional) Controls whether volume correction
    files are written in text (default) or gzip format

- 'record initial particle positions': (Optional) If this is set to a number N,
   where N > 0, then the first N initial particle positions will be written to
   a .pinit file. You can use this file to visualize the initial particle positions
   using gnuplot for example.

- 'current result phantom region': (Optional) Controls which phantom region is
  used for displaying results at the end of each batch and/or terminating the
  calculation if the required statistical uncertainty is reached. Defaults to
  region 0 of the first phantom object.  Currently the result of the
  tracklength dose scoring is always used. See
  [tests/brem_cyl/brem_cyl.egsinp](https://github.com/clrp-code/egs_brachy/blob/master/egs_brachy/tests/brem_cyl/brem_cyl.egsinp) for an
  example.

- 'dose scaling factor': (Optional) Allows you to scale all dose files output by
   egs_brachy by a constant factor.

A sample 'scoring options' block looks like this:
\verbatim

:start scoring options:

    score tracklength dose = yes # 'yes' (default) or 'no'
    score energy deposition = no # 'no' (default) or 'yes'
    score scatter dose = yes # 'no' (default) or 'yes'
    muen file = /home/randlet/egs/HEN_HOUSE/muen_data/brachy_xcom_1.5MeV.muendat
    muen for media = WATER_0.998, AIR_TG43

    dose file format = gzip # text or gzip

    output egsphant files = yes
    egsphant file format = gzip

    output voxel info files = no
    voxel info file format = text # text or gzip

    output volume correction files for phantoms = phantom1, phantom2
    volume correction file format = gzip # text or gzip

    current result phantom region = phantom 123  # phant name and reg number

    dose scaling factor = 1

    :start spectrum scoring:
        type = surface count
        particle type = photon
        minimum energy = 0.001
        maximum energy = 0.040
        number of bins = 100
        output format = xmgr
    :stop spectrum scoring:

    :start phsp scoring:
        phsp output directory = /home/randlet/egs/egsnrc/egs_brachy/
        access mode = write
        print header = no
        kill after scoring = yes
    :stop phsp scoring:

:stop scoring options:

\endverbatim

\subsubsection vcfiles Volume correction files

If one or more phantoms are specfied in 'output volume correction files for
phantoms' then egs\_brachy will output a file containing region numbers and the
corrected volumes for any regions which has had its volume corrected.

File mode is specified with the 'volume correction file format' input and can either
be 'text' or 'gzip'.

These volume correction files allow you to precompute volume corrections for a
given geometry arrangement and can then be used in conjunction with the 'volume
correction from file' volume correction option.  This can be particularly
useful when running a simulation in parallel.  A single job in "volume
correction only" mode can be run to initially calculate the volume corrections
and then the parallel jobs can use the precomputed volume corrections values
eliminating the redundant calculation of volume corrections by every job in
your parallel run.

The input file
[tests/volume_correction/vc.egsinp](https://github.com/clrp-code/egs_brachy/blob/master/egs_brachy/tests/volume_correction/vc.egsinp)
    demonstrates this feature.


\subsubsection specscoring Spectrum Scoring Options

egs\_brachy can currently score three different type of spectra:

1. Absolute counts of particles escaping the surface of the source (See [tests/spec_absolute/spec_absolute.egsinp](https://github.com/clrp-code/egs_brachy/blob/master/egs_brachy/tests/spec_absolute/spec_absolute.egsinp))
2. Energy weighted spectra of particles on the surface of the source (See [tests/spec_eflu/spec_eflu.egsinp](https://github.com/clrp-code/egs_brachy/blob/master/egs_brachy/tests/spec_eflu/spec_eflu.egsinp))
3. Photon energy fluence in a single geometry region (See [tests/spec_vox/spec_vox.egsinp](https://github.com/clrp-code/egs_brachy/blob/master/egs_brachy/tests/spec_vox/spec_vox.egsinp))

To score a spectrum, add one or more 'spectrum scoring' input blocks to the
'scoring options' block (you may add an arbitrary number of 'spectrum scoring'
blocks.)

**Note that for the 'energy fluence in region' spectrum type, it is essential that
the scoring region has no other overlapping geometries.**

Spectrum scoring input options are explained below.

\verbatim

:start scoring options:

    ...


    :start spectrum scoring:
        type = surface count # surface count, energy weighted surface, energy fluence in region
        particle type = photon # photon, electron, positron
        minimum energy = 0.001 # defaults to 0.001MeV
        maximum energy = 1.00 # defaults to max energy of source
        number of bins = 1000  # defaults to 100
        output format = xmgr # xmgr (default), csv, egsnrc

        file extension = my_spectrum # (optional)

        # egsnrc 'output format' only
        egsnrc format mode = 0 # 0, 1, 2

        # 'energy fluence in region' mode only
        geometry  = your_geom_name
        scoring region = 10 # region of specified geometry to score fluence in (defaults to 0 )

    :stop spectrum scoring:

:stop scoring options:

\endverbatim


\subsubsection phspscoring Phase Space Scoring Options

egs\_brachy has the ability to score an IAEA format phase space file of all
particles escaping the source geometry.  This phase space can then be used as a
particle source in future simulations with the eb_iaeaphsp_source source type
(see Phase Space Source section below).

To enable this option you need to add a `phsp scoring` block to the `scoring
options` input section. The `phsp scoring` block has the following inputs:

1. 'phsp output directory': (Optional) Controls where the .IAEAheader & .IAEAphsp files
   are written too. Defaults to the current working directory.

2. 'access mode': (Optional) Controls whether egs_brachy should write to a new file or
   append to an existing phsp file. Options are `write` and `append` (default).

3. 'kill after scoring': (Optional) Controls whether the weight of scored
   particles should be set to 0 which will increase the speed of phase space
   file generation.  Options are `yes` and `no` (default).

4. 'boundary step': (Optional) Since egs\_brachy scores phsp particles on the
   surface of a source, you may find that when you use a phsp source,
   particles get stuck at the geometry boundary when they are initialized. To
   combat this, before scoring a phsp particle egs\_brachy propagates the particle
   a small distance forward along its current direction of travel before writing it
   to the phase space file. By default this value is 1E-4 cm but you can make
   it smaller or larger if necessary.

5. 'print header': (Optional) Controls whether the iaea_print_header function
   is called during the outputResults. Options are `yes` and `no` (default).

A complete phsp scoring block looks like:

\verbatim

    :start phsp scoring:
        phsp output directory = /home/randlet/egs/egsnrc/egs_brachy/
        access mode = write
        print header = no
        kill after scoring = yes
        boundary step = 1E-6
    :stop phsp scoring:

\endverbatim

See
[tests/phsp_scoring/phsp_score.egsinp](https://github.com/clrp-code/egs_brachy/blob/master/egs_brachy/tests/phsp_scoring/phsp_score.egsinp)
for an example of scoring a phase space and
[tests/phsp_run/phsp_run.egsinp](https://github.com/clrp-code/egs_brachy/blob/master/egs_brachy/tests/phsp_run/phsp_run.egsinp) for an
example of running a phase space source.

#### Limitations

Currently phase space generation using parallel runs is not supported.


\subsection sourcedef Source definition

The `source definition` block for egs_brachy consists of 3 parts:

1. a standard egs++ `source` block which defines what the base particle source
   and spectrum will be (typically for brachy calculations this will be an
       isotropic  source).
2. a `transformations` input block which contains one or more
   EGS_AffineTransform input blocks to tell egs_brachy the location of all
   particle sources (this will usually be identical to the `inscribed geometry
       -> transformations` block for an egs_autoenvelope geometry and hence an
       external file and an `include file` directive should probably be used.)
3. a `simulation source` input item which is set to the name of the source
   defined in 1.
4. an optional `source weights` input item which is a list of relative
   statistical weights for each source. This input is described below in the
    `Variable source weights` section.


An example `source definition` block is shown below for a 6702 seed:
\verbatim

:start source definition:

  :start source:

      library = egs_isotropic_source
      name = 6702_spheres
      charge = 0

      # three spherical shell sources for 6702 Source
      :start shape:

          library = egs_shape_collection

          :start shape:
              library = egs_spherical_shell
              inner radius = 0.0299
              outer radius = 0.03
              midpoint = 0, 0, -0.11
          :stop shape:

          :start shape:
              library = egs_spherical_shell
              inner radius = 0.0299
              outer radius = 0.03
              midpoint = 0, 0, 0
          :stop shape:

          :start shape:
              library = egs_spherical_shell
              inner radius = 0.0299
              outer radius = 0.03
              midpoint = 0, 0, 0.11
          :stop shape:

          probabilities = 1 1 1

      :stop shape:

      :start spectrum:

\subsubsection overlap Checking for overlapping sources

egs\_brachy can optionally run a Monte Carlo calculation (similar to volume
    correction routines) to try to determine if any sources are overlapping. To
run this check at the beginning of your simulation add a `source overlap check`
input block to the the `source definition` section.  

A sample `source overlap check` block looks like:

\startverbatim

    :start source overlap check:

        check source overlaps = yes  # yes or no (default)

        warning mode = fatal  # fatal (default) or warning. 
                              # fatal kills the simulation, warning allows it to continue but prints a warning

        density of random points (cm^-3) = 1E6  # density of points to use for checking for overlap

        # bounding shape to use for generating random points around source
        :start shape:
            type = cylinder
            radius = 0.04
            height = 0.46
        :stop shape:

    :stop source overlap check:

\endverbatim

\subsubsection varweight Variable source weighting

In order to simulate sources with different activity levels you can add a
`source weights` input to the `source definition` section.  For example, if you
have a simualtion with two sources, the first of which has three times the
activity of the second, you would set the following source input:

\verbatim

:start source definition:

  :start source:

      library = egs_point_source
      name = pt_source
      charge = 0
      position = 0 0 0

      :start spectrum:
          type = tabulated spectrum
          spectrum file = /home/randlet/egs/HEN_HOUSE/spectra/I125_TG43.spectrum
      :stop spectrum:

  :stop source:

  :start transformations :
      :start transformation:
          translation = 0 0 -1
      :stop transformation:
      :start transformation:
          translation = 0 0 1
      :stop transformation:
  :stop transformations:

  simulation source = pt_source

  source weights = 3 1 # give source at (0, 0, -1) three times the weight of source 2

:stop source definition:

\endverbatim

egs_brachy uses these weights to assign the initial statistical weight of the
particles originating in a source.  If the `source weights` input is missing
all sources are given equal weighting.  If the number of inputs for source
weights is less than the number of sources, the missing inputs will be assumed
to be 1.  See
[tests/variable_activity/variable.egsinp](https://github.com/clrp-code/egs_brachy/blob/master/egs_brachy/tests/variable_activity/variable.egsinp)
for an example.

When the `superposition` run mode is used, the `source weights` input
represents relative dwell times (e.g. for a stepped Ir192 HDR source) rather
than different activity levels.  See
[tests/stepped_source/stepped.egsinp](https://github.com/clrp-code/egs_brachy/blob/master/egs_brachy/tests/stepped_source/stepped.egsinp)
    for an example of this feature.


\subsubsection phspsources Phase Space Sources

Using an IAEA phase space source in egs_brachy is just a matter of
setting the `source` input block to use the eb_iaeaphsp_source type like so:


\verbatim

:start source definition:

    :start source:
        library = eb_iaeaphsp_source
        name = 6702
        header file = /home/randlet/egs/egsnrc/egs_brachy/iaea.phsp.IAEAheader
    :stop source:

    :start transformations :
        include file = lib/geometry/transformations/125seeds_1cm_grid
    :stop transformations:

    simulation source = 6702

:stop source definition:

\endverbatim

See the eb_iaeaphsp_source documenation for more information on the inputs and
[tests/phsp_run/phsp_run.egsinp](https://github.com/clrp-code/egs_brachy/blob/master/egs_brachy/tests/phsp_run/phsp_run.egsinp) input file
for an example of this feature.

It should be noted that phase space sources are treated slightly differently
than other source types when particle recycling is enabled. This is discussed
below in the particle recycling section.


\subsection transport Transport Parameters

egs_brachy has a couple of extra optional transport parameters.

1. `Fluorescent Photon Cutoff` which will kill all fluorescent photons with
   energy less than or equal to the cutoff energy.
\verbatim

:start MC transport parameter:

    Global ECUT                    = 1.512
    Global PCUT                    = 0.001
    # ...
    Fluorescent Photon Cutoff      = 0.005 # kill all flu. photons with E <= 5keV

:stop MC transport parameter:

\endverbatim

2. `Source ECUT` & `Source PCUT` these two transport parameters allow you to
   set ECUT and PCUT to different values within the source compared to elsewhere. This is required
   for x-ray source simulations (see e.g.
       [tests/brem_cyl/brem_cyl.egsinp](https://github.com/clrp-code/egs_brachy/blob/master/egs_brachy/tests/brem_cyl/brem_cyl.egsinp)).

\verbatim

:start MC transport parameter:

    Global ECUT                    = 1.512
    Global PCUT                    = 0.001
    Source ECUT                    = 0.512
    Source PCUT                    = 0.001

:stop MC transport parameter:
\endverbatim

\subsection varreduction Variance Reduction

\subsubsection recycling Particle Recycling

egs_brachy has the ability to reuse particles which escape from the source
geometry an arbitrary number of times. With particle recycling enabled,
egs_brachy detects (in ausgab) when a particle is escaping the source, and then
adds Nrecycle new particles to the top of the stack at the location of
each source in the simulation.

This can increase the efficiency of a
simulation where only a fraction of particles are escaping the source geometry
(since particles which don't escape the source geometry are 'wasted' because
 they don't contribute to dose in the phantom).

In order to enable source particle recycling you must include a `particle recycling`
block in the `variance reduction` block.

\verbatim


:start variance reduction:
    :start particle recycling:
        times to reuse recycled particles = 10
        rotate recycled particles = yes
    :stop particle recycling:
:stop variance reduction:

\endverbatim

If `rotate recycled particles` is set to yes, each particle will be rotated
by an arbitrary angle about the z-axis prior to being reused. (If
`times to reuse recycled particles` is greater than 1, particle rotation is
enforced).

Examples of particle recycling may be seen in the following test files:
[tests/phsp_run/phsp_run.egsinp](https://github.com/clrp-code/egs_brachy/blob/master/egs_brachy/tests/phsp_run/phsp_run.egsinp),
[tests/recycling/recycling.egsinp](https://github.com/clrp-code/egs_brachy/blob/master/egs_brachy/tests/recycling/recycling.egsinp),
[tests/tg43mode_recycle/tg43mode_recycling.egsinp](https://github.com/clrp-code/egs_brachy/blob/master/egs_brachy/tests/tg43mode_recycle/tg43mode_recycling.egsinp),
[tests/variable_w_recycling/variable_w_recycling.egsinp](https://github.com/clrp-code/egs_brachy/blob/master/egs_brachy/tests/variable_w_recycling/variable_w_recycling.egsinp).


#### Particle Recycling with PHSP Sources

Phase space particles are scored once they've already escaped the source and
therefore particles from a phsp source will be initiated outside of sources.
Because of this phsp particles never escape the source and trigger the
recycling routines in ausgab.  Instead, at the beginning of each history a
single particle is retrieved from the phase space file and then NRecycle copies
of the particle are made and placed at the location of all the sources (so the
    history starts with NRecyle\*NSource particles on the stack rather than
    just a single particle).

#### Particle Recycling and Superposition Mode

Currently when running in superposition mode recycled particles are only
generated for the currently active source rather than all source locations (
    i.e. when a particle escapes a source only `Nrecycle` particles are created
    rather than `Nrecycle*Nsource`).

\subsubsection rangerejection Range Rejection

Range rejection is enabled outside of sources and disabled within
sources by default in egs_brachy. The default maximum range rejection
energy is set to 2.511 MeV (including rest mass). In other words, by
default range rejection is applied to electrons in the phantom with
kinetic energy lower than 2 MeV.  To enable or disable range rejection
within sources, or outside of sources, use the `source range rejection`
and `global range rejection` inputs, respectively.

The `source range rejection max energy` and `global range rejection max
energy` inputs are used to set the maximum energy of electrons (in MeV,
    including rest mass) to use range rejection with.

\verbatim

:start variance reduction:
    global range rejection = yes
    global range rejection max energy = 0.611
    source range rejection = yes
    source range rejection max energy = 0.516
:stop variance reduction:

\endverbatim


\subsubsection bremsplit Bremsstrahlung Splitting

To enable brem splitting in egs_brachy set  the `split brems photons` input to
something greater than 1 in the `variance reduction` block.

\verbatim

:start variance reduction:
    split brem photons = 100
:stop variance reduction:

\endverbatim

See [tests/brem_cyl/brem_cyl.egsinp](https://github.com/clrp-code/egs_brachy/blob/master/egs_brachy/tests/brem_cyl/brem_cyl.egsinp) for
an input file that uses brem splitting.

\subsubsection bcse Bremsstrahlung Cross Section Enhancement

To enable bremsstrahlung cross section enhancement in egs_brachy add a
`bcse medium` input item in the `variance reduction` block.  The format
of the input is `medium_name enhancement_factor`.

\verbatim

:start variance reduction:
    split brem photons = 100
    bcse medium =  Ti10W90 100
:stop variance reduction:

\endverbatim

\subsection voxvc Voxel volume correction details

egs_brachy has three methods available for doing voxel volume correction
calculations in rectilinear, cylindrical and spherical geometries.  There is a
'fast' method that uses the same technique described in the egs_autoenvelope
documentation and a more general purpose routine which can be used for larger
volumes with multiple overlapping phantom geometries. In addition to those two
methods, corrected voxel volumes can be precomputed (either manually or by
egs\_brachy) and read from a file. Finally, there is a fourth method,
`phantom region volumes` that can be used to specify manually calcualted
voxel volumes in the input file for other geometry types (e.g. conical
 geometries).

See [tests/volume_correction/vc.egsinp](https://github.com/clrp-code/egs_brachy/blob/master/egs_brachy/tests/volume_correction/vc.egsinp) for
examples of the fast & general volume correction methods.

\subsubsection sourcevc Fast voxel volume corrections for sources

The input block for this type of volume correction looks like:

\verbatim

:start volume correction:

    :start source volume correction:

        correction type = correct # optional: none(default), correct, zero dose
        density of random points (cm^-3) = 1E7 # optional random point sampling density defaults to 1E8

        total coverage threshold % = 99.9 # optional level of voxel coverage before it is considered totally covered
                                          # if a voxel is more than 99.9% (default) covered then it's volume is set to 0

        # shape which encompasses source
        :start shape:
            type = cylinder
            radius = 0.04
            height = 0.45
        :stop shape:

        # optional rng definition
        :start rng definition:
            type = sobol
            initial seed = 1234
        :stop rng definition:

        # -or- #
        :start rng definition:
            type = ranmar
            initial seeds = two integers
        :stop rng definition:

    :stop source volume correction:

:stop volume correction:
\endverbatim

\subsubsection genvc General purpose volume corrections

The general purpose algorithm is similar, except any geometry region within
the bounding shape will have its region volume corrected
Currently the shape must be cylinder, sphere, or box type.

The input block for the general purpose volume corrections is shown below:

\verbatim

:start volume correction:

    :start extra volume correction:

        correction type = correct # correct, none, zero dose
        density of random points (cm^-3) = 1E5

        # correct volume of region for all geometries within
        # x,y,z = +/- 2cm around origin
        :start shape:

            type = box
            box size = 4

            :start transformation:
                translation = 0 0 0
            :stop transformation:

        :stop shape:

    :stop extra volume correction:

:stop volume correction:

\endverbatim

\subsubsection vcfile Volume calculations from file

You can also use precomputed volume corrections by using a 'volume correction
from file' input.

The input block specifies one or more 'phantom file' inputs with two strings.
The first string is the name of the phantom to set the volumes for and the second
string is the file to read the volumes from.  egs\_brachy will automatically
determine whether the file is in text or gzip mode.

\verbatim

:start volume correction:

    :start volume correction from file:

        phantom file = phantom1 your_precomputed_phantom1_volumes.volcor
        phantom file = phantom2 your_precomputed_phantom2_volumes.volcor

    :stop volume correction from file:

:stop volume correction:

\endverbatim

To create your own volcor text files, create a text file in the format:

\verbatim

NRECORDS
REG_NUM_1 REG_1_VOLUME
REG_NUM_2 REG_2_VOLUME
...
REG_NUM_3 REG_3_VOLUME

\endverbatim

for example the following file:

\verbatim

3
5 0.5
13 1.0
1000 2.5

\endverbatim

would set regions 5, 13 and 1000 to volumes 0.5 cm^3, 1 cm^3, 2.5 cm^3 of
whichever phantom it was assigned to.

\subsubsection rngvc Random Number Generator for volume corrections

If a `box` shape is used as the volume correction shape,
volume corrections will use a Sobol Quasi Random Number Generator by
default. For all other shapes the regular Ranmar RNG will be used (the Sobol
 generator only works for Cartesian coordinate systems). The RNG can
be overridden as show in the example above.


\subsubsection vcuser Manually specifying voxel volumes

For calculating dose in phantoms which are not rectilinear, cylindrical, or
spherical you may use `phantom region volumes` blocks to specify the the volume
of one or more regions in a phantom (note, it will also work in e.g.
    rectilinear phantoms, it's just not generally needed). The format of these
blocks is:

\verbatim

:start volume correction:

    :start phantom region volumes:
        phantom name = <phantom_name>
        region numbers = r_1 r_2 ... r_i ... r_N
        region volumes = V_1 V_2 ... V_i ... V_N
    :stop phantom region volumes:

:stop volume correction:

\endverbatim

for example to specify volumes of 0.5cm^3 and 1cm^3 for regions 1 and 3
respectively in a phantom called `my_phantom` you would do:

\verbatim

:start volume correction:

    :start phantom region volumes:
        phantom name = my_phantom
        region numbers = 1 3 
        region volumes = 0.5 1
    :stop phantom region volumes:

:stop volume correction:

\endverbatim

if you try to calculate dose in a geometry type that doesn't support automatic
volume calculations without including a `phantom region volumes` block,
       egs\_brachy will print a warning and terminate.

\subsection outputfiles Output files


\subsubsection dosefiles 3ddose files

A 3ddose file will be output for every phantom geometry named in the
`geometry definition -> phantom geometries` input item.  The filename
format of these 3ddose files is `{input_file}_{phantom_name}.3ddose` where
`{input_file}` is replaced with the name of the simulations input file and
`{phantom_name}` is replaced with the name of the phantom.

If `score energy deposition = yes` is set, a second 3ddose file with dose from
interaction scoring will be output to `{input_file}_{phantom_name}.edep.3ddose`
as well.

If `score scatter dose` is enabled, egs_brachy will score primary, single
scattered and multiple scattered dose (normalized to total radiant energy) and
output them to 3ddose files with the format `{input_file}_{phantom_name}.{pr,ss,ms,to}.3ddose`

Note that for voxels with volume corrections, the uncertainty in the 3ddose
file represents the total uncertainty of the calculation which is the error on
the dose calculation added in quadrature to the error on the volume correction
calculation.


\subsubsection egsphant egsphant file

If the user sets `output egsphant files` to yes in the `scoring options` input block, an
egsphant file will be output for each scoring phantom in the simulation.

\verbatim
:start scoring options:


    #...
    output egsphant files = yes

:stop scoring options:
\endverbatim


\subsubsection voxinfo Voxel info files

If the user sets `output voxel info files` to yes in the `scoring options`
input block, a file with a .voxels extension
(`{input_file}_{phantom_name}.voxels`) will be output that contains region by
region information about every voxel in a phantom. The information currently
includes, region #, corrected volume, uncorrected volume, mass, density,
    medium, dose and uncertainy.

\verbatim
:start scoring options:


    #...
    output voxel info files = yes

:stop scoring options:
\endverbatim


\subsection runsim Running a simulation

egs_brachy uses the standard egs++ `run control` input block to control
the number of histories, batches, geometry erorr limits etc.. Likewise
the standard methods of running EGSnrc user codes from the command line
all apply to egs_brachy (i.e. use `ex`, `exb` or `egs_brachy -i
    input_file [-p pegs_file] [-o output_file] [-s] [-P n -j i]`)


\section runtests Test Suite

egs_brachy comes with a test suite that will allow you to confirm
the code is still performing as expected after making modifications
or updating the egsnrc version.

Geometries required for the tests are either defined within the .egsinp
files or within [eb_tests/test_geoms](https://github.com/clrp-code/egs_brachy/blob/master/egs_brachy/eb_tests/test_geoms).

\subsection setup Setup

In order to make accurate CPU time comparisons the test suite needs to know how
fast your CPU is.  If you are on a linux system that makes processor speed
available in `/proc/cpuinfo/` then the test suite can likely determine this information
on its own.  Otherwise you will need to set a `CPU_MHZ` environment variable with the
value of your CPU speed in MHz (e.g. `CPU_MHZ=2400`).

\subsection testsuite Running the test suite

To run the test suite you need to be in the root egs\_brachy directory.
To run the whole test suite type (tested with Python 2.7 & 3.4):

\verbatim
python run_tests.py
\endverbatim

after which you should see output like:

\verbatim

~/egs/egsnrc/egs_brachy$ python run_tests.py

\section makedocs Documentation

This egs_brachy Technical Reference Manual uses doxygen and Python to build its documentation. Documentation
for the egs_brachy library and test suite are generated by a number of Python
scripts located in the _docs directory. The Python scripts generate markdown
documents based on the contents of the `lib` and `eb_tests` directory. These
markdown documents are then compiled to html by doxygen. A pdf of all the
documentation will also be created and placed at `docs/pdf/egs_brachy_technical_manual.pdf`.

This document (egs_brachy.md) and the scripts for generating the library and
test documents are located in `_docs/` and the generated html is placed in
`docs/` ( the documents in the `docs/` directory should not be modified
    manually).

To update the documentation simply run `make docs` and then commit the changes:

```
make docs
git add _docs/ docs/
git commit -am 'your commit message'

```
